Craps game Modification
Modify the craps program of fig 5 to allow wagering, Initialize variable bankBalance to 1000 dollars.  
Prompt the player to enter a wager Check that wager is less than or equal to bankBalance, and if it's not  have
the user reenter a wager until a valid wager is entered.  Then, run one game of craps.  If the player wins, increase
the bankBalance by the wager amount, if the player loses decrease the bankBalance by the wager amount.  Display the 
new bankBalance, check wheather bankBalance has become zero, and if so display the message "Sorry, you busted!" As the game
progresses, display various messages to create some "chatter", such as "Oh, you're going for broke, huh?",  or "Aw C'mon, take a chance!", 
or "You're up big, Now's the time to cash in your chips!", Implement the "chatter"
as a separate method that randomly chooses the string to display.
